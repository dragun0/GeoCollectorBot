# Geo Collector Bot examples

This folder contains Bots set up with different configurations that can run out-of-the-box with Docker Compose.

To run those examples you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Furthermore, you will need a valid Telegram authentication token, that you can create following
[the official documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).
